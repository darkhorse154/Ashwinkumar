    "# Machine Learning DA\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The below code is to identify the 3 different species of Iris Flowers that exist, namely Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. The species are differentiated based on 4 parameters. This code uses a K Nearest Neighbour Classification Algorithm to identify and classify the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the dataset\n",
    "The dataset used here is a standard, commonly available dataset called the iris dataset (GitHub link provided along with other references). This dataset contains 4 input parameters, namely the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width (in that order). The last parameter is the output parameter, which is the species corresponding to that specific set of input parameters. In the GitHub link, these values are provided as a CSV file. However, the same dataset is also available in Scikit-learn, which is the Machine Learning Library I am using to train the model (explained later on in the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning model used\n",
    "The machine learning model used here is called the Nearest Neighbour Classification model. Neighbors-based classification is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning: it does not attempt to construct a general internal model but simply stores instances of the training data. Classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbours of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbours of the point. The k-neighbors classification in KNeighborsClassifier is the most commonly used technique. The optimal choice of the value 'k' is highly data-dependent: in general a larger k value suppresses the effects of noise, but makes the classification boundaries less distinct."

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall concept\n",
    "This problem is relatively easy to implement using a free, widely used machine learning library for Python called Scikit-learn. This library does most of the model generation, training and testing, while still allowing us to modify certain values as required by the end user. In this case, as explained earlier, since the number of input parameters is low, and the input data is neatly labelled, this is a job best suited for a Nearest Neighbour Classsification Model. This is easily implemented using the 'KNeighboursClassifier' available in Scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "The entire Machine Learning process can be split into 7 distinct parts. They are listed below:\n",
    "1) Importing the Data\n",
    "2) Cleaning the Data\n",
    "3) Sorting the Data\n",
    "4) Splitting the Data\n",
    "5) Training the Model\n",
    "6) Analysing the performance of the Model\n",
    "7) Deployment of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "These different parts are defined and elaborated below."

    "### Part 1 and 2 - Importing and Cleaning the Data\n",
    "To go about this project, we first need to import the data. This can either be done using the GitHub repo (link provided above), or through the in-built iris dataset in Scikit-learn. For this application, we shall use the in-built version, as it is easier to deal with than a CSV file. The next part of the process is to clean the data and remove points which are noisy. This need not be done in this case, as the dataset available in Scikit-learn is already verified, and considered to be clean. However, for other datasets, it is advisable to go through the data and clean it. Not doing this cleaning step can lead to the model either underfitting or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when a model is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively result in poor performance both on the training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical model is said to be overfitted when the model does not make accurate predictions on testing data. When a model gets trained with so much data, it starts learning from the noise and inaccurate data entries in our data set. And when testing with test data results in High variance. Then the model does not categorize the data correctly, because of too many details and noise."

    "If the test size is too high, then the training dataset will be small, which will make the model inaccurate, and be able to predict the answers accurately.\n",

The industry standard for the test dataset size is around 20% and this is what we will also use.

We used the Nearest Neighbours Classification Algorithm, provided by the Scikit-learn library.
